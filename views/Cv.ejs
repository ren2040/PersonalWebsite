      <p>2017 - Current – Hackney Council (Student Software Developer)</p> 
      <p>Throughout my time within Hackney Council I have gained significant experience in Software Product Development and maintenance. I have been given many opportunities to develop numerous stand-alone applications, Integration applications, web applications and web forms which I have successfully completed and delivered. I have developed many of these applications independently through the stage of collecting requirements, to planning, implementing and testing the said project. I have also worked on more complex projects alongside my team members in the Development Team.</p> <br/>
      
      <p>2016 - 2017 – Evolve Hospitality Agency (Hospitality work)</p>
      <p>During my time working for Evolve Hospitality Agency I gained significant experience and responsibilities and an understanding about the expectations of service. I had many different duties at Evolve as each day put me into a new role varying from being a bartender to waiter, cook assistant and steward. It had brought me out of my comfort zone and given me the opportunity to adapt to new situation.</p> <br/>

      <p>First Touch Certificate Uploader</p> 
      <p>This is one of the largest but also my first project I completed at Hackney Council. It is an integration tool which I had developed for the document management system within Hackney Council using C#. It was also complemented by a dashboard which I had developed using ASP.NET MVC model. I had developed this application from the stage of collecting requirements, to planning and designing using UML and implementing and testing the completed application. It is now in daily use within the Council.</p> <br/>
      
      <p>Property Sales Reservation Form </p> 
      <p>This was a form I had developed for the Hackney Sales branch of the Hackney Council. The form was developed to collect customer details as well as allow them to make a payment through the form for a particular property they may be interested in purchasing from the Council. This was developed using ASP.NET MVC. </p> <br/>
      
      <p>API Development</p> 
      <p>I have worked on numerous API projects throughout my time in the council such as the Hackney Repairs API which was built using C# ASP.NET. I also have some API development experience using Ruby On Rails which I had studied during my free time.</p> <br/>
      
      <p class="titles">Personal Development</p> <br/>
      <p>Udemy</p>
      <p>I regularly use Udemy as a source to study new programming languages and technologies in my free time. I have used C# extensively in the past to advance my knowledge in C# and ASP.NET. I am currently using Udemy to expand my knowledge on Unity Game Engine and developing games on C#. </p> <br/>
     
      <p>Shaped</p> 
      <p>Shaped is an RPG game which I have been working on recently, developed using Unity Game Engine and C#. This is an independent project which I had decided to work on in my free time as I have a passion for Game Development and I thoroughly enjoy it. </p> <br/>
      
      <p class="titles">Transferable Skills</p> <br/>
      <p>I have undertaken a variety of roles throughout my career and with my time as a student. Each significantly different from the last, but I have adapted to each one rapidly by dedicating myself to it’s duties.</p> <br/>

      <p>Self-disciplined – I always prioritise my duties and responsibilities first, as I truly believe self-discipline is the pinnacle of success.</p> <br/>
      <p>Concise communication skills – I am capable to delivering and presenting myself vocally through concise and clear language. </p> <br/>

I have always had a passion for games ever since I was young, this has developed and fit into my interest in Computer Science over time.</p> <br/>
